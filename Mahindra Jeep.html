            The Mahindra Jeep (CJ / MM540) is one of the most rugged and iconic
            vehicles in Indian automotive history. Manufactured by Mahindra &
            Mahindra, these Jeeps were inspired by the original Willys Jeep and
            became synonymous with strength, reliability, and off-road
            capability. Introduced in India in the 1950s and popular for several
            decades, the CJ and MM540 models were widely used by the Indian
            Army, police forces, farmers, and rural communities. Known for their
            simple mechanical design and tough ladder-frame chassis, Mahindra
            Jeeps were built to survive harsh terrains, including mountains,
            deserts, and muddy village roads. They were powered mainly by diesel
            engines, offering high torque and excellent durability. The 4x4
            capability made them ideal for off-roading and extreme conditions,
            while their easy maintenance ensured long service life even in
            remote areas. Though basic in comfort, the CJ and MM540 were highly
            dependable and versatile, often modified for personal, agricultural,
            or military use. Even today, these Jeeps enjoy a cult following
            among off-road enthusiasts and collectors. Restored versions are
            commonly seen in rallies, adventure drives, and exhibitions. The
            Mahindra Jeep remains a proud symbol of India’s engineering strength
            and adventurous spirit.
