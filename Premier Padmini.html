            The Premier Padmini is one of the most iconic cars in Indian
            automotive history and holds a special place in the hearts of
            millions. Manufactured by Premier Automobiles Limited (PAL), the
            Padmini was launched in 1973 and was based on the Italian Fiat
            1100D. With its compact size, elegant European design, and reliable
            performance, the car quickly became popular among Indian families
            and taxi operators. It was especially famous in Mumbai, where the
            black-and-yellow Premier Padmini taxis became a defining part of the
            city’s identity. The car was powered mainly by a petrol engine,
            known for its smooth operation and easy maintenance, making it ideal
            for everyday use. Its rear-wheel-drive setup and sturdy build
            allowed it to handle Indian road conditions effectively. Though the
            interior was simple, it offered sufficient comfort for small
            families and long drives. For many middle-class households, owning a
            Premier Padmini was a matter of pride and a symbol of upward
            mobility.
